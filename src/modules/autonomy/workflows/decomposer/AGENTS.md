# Decomposer Workflow

Decomposer rescopes a failed builder task after timeout or exhausted repair.

- It triggers only from a failed builder completion and reads the canonical run
  metadata and immutable builder trigger contract from `.kota/runs/<run-id>`.
- The builder payload identifies one task and digest. Decomposer rechecks that
  contract against the current verified task snapshot; changed, terminal, or
  non-actionable work is superseding evidence and skips decomposition.
- Builder and decomposer bind the same `task:<taskId>` logical resource.
  `RunStateDatabase` owns exclusivity; there is no task-claim file or
  builder-specific lease.
- The workflow declares repository write access and task validation.
  `RunLifecycle` supplies the sandbox and `IntegrationQueue` publishes the
  result only after the failed builder's source task contract still matches
  the canonical snapshot used for the final rebase.
- Planning and review agents are read-only. Review compares the plan with the
  exact screened task markdown before mutation.
- `apply-decomposition` is the only semantic mutation path. It uses repo-tasks
  operations to create dependency-linked ready tasks, annotate the original,
  and move it to `dropped`.
- Tests cover source authentication, superseding task evidence, shared resource
  binding, approved mutations, and observable queue outcomes rather than claim
  artifacts or commit mechanics.

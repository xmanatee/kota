# Autonomy Module

This module owns the project autonomous development loop.

- Keep the autonomous workflows inside this module.
- Shared helpers used only by these workflows belong here too.
- Do not recreate a parallel workflow catalog in core just to surface these workflows.
- Durable autonomous learning belongs in scoped `AGENTS.md` guidance at the
  narrowest useful directory. Evidence belongs in run artifacts and git history;
  do not create a second lessons store or inject stale summaries into prompts.
- Promote a lesson only when repeated run evidence shows a durable pattern.
  Retract or narrow guidance when code, behavior, or ownership changes.
- Workflow-specific prompts should stay role-focused. Shared policy and
  operating conventions belong in this module's `AGENTS.md` hierarchy.

# Slack Module

This directory owns the Slack notification module — routes KOTA notification events to a Slack Incoming Webhook.

- No OAuth app or bot token required; only a webhook URL (`modules.slack.webhookUrl`).
- `approval.requested` is always forwarded when the module is configured.
- Default notification events: `workflow.failure.alert`, `workflow.attention.digest`.
- `workflow.build.committed` is opt-in (must be listed in config `events`).
- Uses `postWithRetry` from the `notification` module for delivery with exponential-backoff retry.
- Declares a dependency on the `notification` module.

## Boundaries

- Does not own Telegram or generic webhook notification (those belong in `telegram/` and `webhook/`).
- Does not own inbound Slack interactions or slash commands.
- Does not own retry logic (that lives in the `notification` module).

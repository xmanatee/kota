/**
 * Skill-ops client contracts.
 *
 * The skill-ops module owns the `skills` KotaClient namespace end-to-end:
 * the per-skill summary shape, the list/import result envelopes, the
 * import options, and the `SkillsClient` interface itself. The aggregate
 * `KotaClient` interface in `src/core/server/kota-client.ts` composes this
 * contract by importing `SkillsClient` from this module instead of
 * declaring the shapes inline.
 *
 * The local-side handler (`localClient(ctx)` in `index.ts`) and the
 * daemon-side handler (`daemonClient(link)` in `index.ts`) both realize
 * `SkillsClient`; the `kota skill` CLI consumes them through
 * `ctx.client.skills`.

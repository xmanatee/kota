# Codex Agent Harness Module

Adapter module that registers the `codex` harness. The harness shells out to
the installed Codex CLI (`codex exec --json`) instead of calling
`@openai/agents` directly. This is load-bearing: Codex CLI is the surface that
honors `codex login` and ChatGPT-plan subscription access, while the OpenAI
Agents SDK requires API-key auth.

Use the `codex` preset, default harness config, or a per-step `harness` to
route a run through this adapter.

## Provider Routing

Models are passed to `codex exec --model` verbatim. The shipped Codex preset
maps fast, balanced, and capable work to GPT-5.6 Luna, Terra, and Sol. The
adapter projects shared native executable/locale state, the Codex login locator,
and the trusted native upstream-proxy setting. The shared native sandbox consumes
that setting to chain provider egress and removes it before launching the CLI.
`OPENAI_API_KEY` and unrelated daemon credentials do not enter
the child, so exported keys cannot take priority over local Codex login.

KOTA supports Codex CLI `0.144.1` or newer for this GPT-5.6 integration.

Account quota inspection uses the installed CLI's app-server account RPC,
with no agent turns or reset-credit consumption. Normalize only the weekly
Codex account bucket; never substitute Spark, five-hour limits, or run usage.

Reasoning effort maps to Codex CLI's `model_reasoning_effort` config:

- `low` -> `low`
- `medium` -> `medium`
- `high` -> `high`
- `xhigh` -> `xhigh`
- `max` -> `max`

## Loop Shape

The adapter runs one non-interactive CLI process per KOTA harness call:

1. Compose the KOTA system prompt, workflow rails, and task prompt into one
   stdin prompt for `codex exec -`.
2. Spawn a strict-config `codex exec --json` process with user
   plugins and hooks disabled and the selected model. Codex owns the single
   tool sandbox through an invocation-generated permission profile: model
   tools stay offline, writes follow the projected scope, project and provider
   credentials are denied, and approvals fail closed. KOTA owns the isolated
   runtime, provider proxy, process lifecycle, and live-policy abort.
3. Parse JSONL events from stdout. Completed command executions are projected
   into neutral tool-call/result evidence, while `item.completed` agent-message
   events are streamed to the optional `AgentHarnessWriter` and collected as
   final text.
4. Read the final `turn.completed` usage event for token counts and return the
   neutral `AgentHarnessResult`.

Cancellation terminates the CLI process group so spawned tools cannot outlive
the CLI, and the run-local quarantine barrier stays pending until the group
leader has closed. The barrier also covers prelaunch validation so rejected
options release ownership without claiming that a process launched.

`passive` is rejected because the adapter cannot classify and deny every
non-safe native shell/tool invocation before it runs. `supervised` is rejected
because this non-interactive CLI path cannot route approvals through KOTA's
approval queue. Autonomous writes remain bounded by the effective scope policy.

## Capability Boundary

Codex CLI owns its tool runtime and sandbox. This adapter does not expose
KOTA's tool registry, MCP servers, `allowedTools`, `disallowedTools`, `canUseTool`, or
scope-policy evaluator to the model. It declares `toolControl: "native"` and
rejects unsupported neutral options before Codex CLI starts. The generated
permission profile enforces scope independently of the prompt, and a stricter
live policy revision aborts the process.
`askOwnerToolName` is therefore `null`, so workflow prompts do not advertise a
fake `ask_owner` tool. Workflows that need owner escalation should use the
deterministic `askOwnerSteps` recipe outside the agent step.

Workspace configuration uses existing workspace read access. Configuration
symlinks confer no authority over external targets; shared configurations
require independent runtime-owned read grants supplied in harness run options.
The adapter carries those grants through the launcher into the generated tool
permission profile; scope configuration and prompts cannot supply them.

The adapter still carries KOTA's shared native workflow rails in the prompt:
agents treat Git metadata as read-only, leave workspace changes unstaged for
runtime-owned commits, and must not stop or control the daemon that launched
them. Post-step workflow checks remain responsible for validating repo state.
It uses a fresh `CODEX_HOME` and explicitly disables plugins and hooks, so
operator-global extensions cannot affect daemon-launched workflow steps;
Codex auth is copied into the provider-only per-invocation runtime home.
Tool permissions deny both the original login credential and the runtime home,
preserving lexical and resolved identities over overlapping grants.
Trusted host isolation may replace `HOME`; the adapter projects only the
resolved `CODEX_HOME` locator so local login remains available without
restoring the operator home environment. Contained eval launches use the adapter's
single-file login declaration; the eval owner snapshots it outside the candidate
workspace and supplies a read-only container login directory. The same native
permission profile denies the mounted credential and disposable runtime home to
tools. Credential readability is not proof of a valid login or model entitlement.
Native and contained provider policies share the adapter-owned endpoint declaration
so login renewal and inference require the same allowlist.

## Session storage

Core binds one native thread to each logical conversation. `thread.started`
checkpoints identity immediately; continuation uses `exec resume <uuid>` and
never `--last`. Each invocation receives fresh authentication and permissions in
its disposable `CODEX_HOME`. Only native rollout directories point into the
protected, scope-owned conversation store, so home or worktree cleanup cannot
erase them. Explicitly declined preservation uses `--ephemeral`. Missing or
corrupt owned rollout metadata produces an evidenced successor through core;
provider/authentication failures keep the original identity. Histories produced
by older ephemeral launches cannot be reconstructed.

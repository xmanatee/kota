/**
 * KotaClient — the typed contract every CLI subcommand consumes for
 * daemon-or-local access to KOTA capabilities.
 *
 * The contract is the single public surface CLI code imports. Two
 * implementors realize it:
 *
 * - `DaemonControlClient` (HTTP) — talks to a running daemon over
 *   `127.0.0.1` using the bearer token published in
 *   `.kota/daemon-control.json`.
 * - `LocalKotaClient` (in-process) — talks directly to the local stores
 *   and providers when no daemon is reachable.
 *
 * A single `resolveKotaClient` selector picks one implementor at CLI
 * startup. Subcommands consume `ctx.client.<namespace>.<method>` and
 * never re-decide that policy themselves.
 *
 * New capabilities are added as namespaces. Each namespace is a typed
 * sub-interface with the operations the CLI needs. Module-owned local
 * implementations are registered through ModuleContext and assembled
 * into the `LocalKotaClient` by the selector.

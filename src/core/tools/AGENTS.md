# Tools

Core owns the agent/session tool pipeline, guardrails, daemon coordination and
module lifecycle. General-purpose capabilities belong in modules.

## Ownership

- `index.ts` installs core tool declarations. Implementations consume
  `tool-registry.ts`; registry reads do not initialize implementations. Registrations return exact
  disposers; module labels are metadata, not cleanup authority.
- `tool-runner` owns admission, input/output validation, approvals and execution.
  It enforces agent write scope and isolated output roots before local writes,
  failing closed on opaque targets. Nested calls inherit its permissions,
  scope and session context; module callbacks alone grant no tool authority.
- `tool-middleware` provides one continuation per invocation. Retry and caching
  belong to the capability that knows an operation's effects and resource identity.
- `guardrails-config.ts` owns configuration decoding and policy snapshots;
  `guardrails.ts` and `guardrails-classify.ts` assess execution risk.
- `audit-store` owns audit records and approval-review redaction.
  `protected-scope-paths` owns the credential boundary shared by filesystem
  tools and native CLI sandboxes. Conversation stores in the canonical scope
  and workspace remain protected through resolved aliases, independently of
  the execution directory.
- `session-environment` owns live session/scope credential overlays. Registration
  owns teardown; stale approvals cannot recreate an ended session's overlay.
- Filesystem mutation targets come from the registered tool's pure
  `resolveFilesystemTargets` declaration using the runner's execution context.
  Declare every destination, including derived paths and ancillary mutations;
  Network operations declare ancillary download destinations through the same
  contract. A declaration of no ancillary writes never exempts a local write effect;
  opaque execution and unresolved dynamic target sets remain unknown and are
  denied under bounded write policies. Generic input fields grant no authority.
- Executable approvals snapshot the registry generation, declaration, resolved
  effect, inputs, execution roots and targets, including opaque operations.
  Preflight leases that exact definition and runner;
  dispatch rejects operation drift. Nested runner overrides cannot borrow the
  registered operation's authority.

## Core capabilities

- `agent_status`: inspect runtime tools, modules, providers, groups and config.
- `approval`: review and resolve the daemon's queued tool calls.
- `ask_user`: interactive terminal input. `ask_owner`: asynchronous escalation.
- `confirm`: session confirmation for high-stakes actions.
- `delegate`: sub-agent execution through the harness protocol.
- `checkpoint`: track and undo session file changes.
- `todo`: provider-backed task state contributed to session context.
- `module_factory`: edits saved manifests. Discovery, trust, activation and
  unload belong to `ModuleLoader`; saved files do not imply live registration.

## Owner questions

`ask_owner` validates through the review gate, enqueues a question and returns
its id immediately. It does not hold the agent loop open or poll for an answer.

Workflow callers use `askOwnerSteps` from `#core/workflow/ask-owner-step.js`:
ask, wait for `owner.question.resolved` matched by question id, then consume the
queue's terminal result and screen its content. The workflow runtime persists
that wait under the run's `awaits/` directory and restores it after restart.
Interactive sessions use `ask_user` for direct input and `ask_owner` for an
answer that may arrive after the current turn ends.

## Autonomy

Every session boundary declares its autonomy mode. `resolveAutonomyGate` runs
before per-tool guardrails:

- `passive`: deny non-safe tools.
- `supervised`: queue non-safe tools for operator approval.
- `autonomous`: apply the configured guardrail policy.

Workflow steps translate mode into neutral harness options (`permissionMode`,
`allowedTools`, `disallowedTools`). Passive mode uses `permissionMode: "default"`
and a read-only tool set because subprocess harnesses cannot see this pipeline.
Autonomous mode leaves the neutral permission mode unset; each adapter owns its
mapping, including Claude's guarded `default` mode. Explicit per-harness
options follow the contract in `src/core/agent-harness/AGENTS.md`.

Only the operator control API changes mode. Session user messages and untrusted
tool/web output cannot escalate it; injection defense screens external content.
The loop reads current mode each tool batch, so changes apply to future calls,
not work already in flight. Per-tool approval does not change session mode.
Clients omitting an explicit mode use `config.serve.defaultAutonomyMode`; other
session boundaries have no hidden compile-time fallback.

## Code execution

Manifest-defined tools declare Python or Node.js code. Core owns
schemas, validation, persistence and conversion to `KotaModule`; executor
modules implement the neutral `CodeRunner` protocol in `code-runner.ts`.
They register on load and deregister on unload. `runCode(language, code,
params, timeoutMs?)` delegates parameter wrapping, timeout defaults and output
truncation to that runner.

Without a registered runner, invocation returns an explicit error. Loading a manifest does not execute it. Core never imports an
executor implementation.

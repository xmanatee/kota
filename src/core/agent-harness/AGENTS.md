# Agent Harness Protocol

Core owns protocol, registry and continuity; modules own adapters.

## Protocol

- `AgentHarnessRunOptions.systemPrompt` carries portable `buildKotaSystemPrompt`
  text; adapters own provider envelopes.
- Neutral options carry tool risk, live scope policy, commit/daemon guards, and
  injection defense (`scopePolicy`, `getScopePolicySnapshot`, `canUseTool`, MCP
  and tool lists). KOTA-routable loops must honor them; other adapters declare
  them in `unsupportedRunOptions`, so `runAgentHarness` rejects them before
  hooks or launch.
- Harnesses enforce `AgentDef.writeScope` before scope mutation; Git checks
  backstop it. Workflow agents receive one separately propagated per-run output
  directory, never the canonical run directory containing runtime state.
- Nested handoffs and delegates are authorization boundaries: carry both
  policy options; inherited tool lists and `canUseTool` are insufficient.
- `sessionContext` is tool-runtime identity, not workflow trace/span metadata.
  `runAgentHarness` creates one per invocation; persistent interactive callers
  register one outer lifetime and reuse its context through teardown.
- `runAgentHarness` rejects late output after abort/settlement; identity checkpoints
  remain valid during adapter ownership. Native stop barriers run on cancellation
  and ordinary settlement, including calls without an abort controller. Native and
  nested launches use `createNativeAgentInvalidationLifecycle` for abort propagation,
  restrictive policy, and idempotent cleanup.
- `guards.ts` owns hidden agent/worktree nesting, commit, daemon-control, and
  authority guards. Its OS sandbox gives opaque code and native CLIs minimal
  environments, isolated home/temp, scope package-manager runtimes,
  declared auth/read roots, and provider-only egress through a host-owned proxy.
  Native tools lack direct host, loopback, metadata-service, or internet routes.
  KOTA native sandboxes protect `.kota`; only validated `KOTA_RUN_DIR` /
  `KOTA_RUN_TEMP_DIR` evidence and temp paths are writable. Native writer task
  authorization crosses a per-invocation, runtime-owned request/reply boundary:
  only its request directory is additionally writable; responses are read-only.
  Raw daemon databases and SQLite journals never cross the agent read boundary.
  Every native invocation derives those denials from host-owned open database
  locators, including custom state roots, independently of writer authorization.
  Conventional invocation/host state roots remain protected without an open store.
  Linux read denials cover every mounted surface, including writable roots and
  runtime write boundaries that have no explicit read grant.
  File-denied directories use private, read-only Linux namespace projections:
  existing permitted entries retain their effective mounts, while future host
  entries stay invisible. Journal masking never creates host SQLite files.
  Absent mask mountpoints beneath read-only binds require a private projection
  of their existing ancestor before the mask is installed. Writable ancestors
  stay host-bound so workspace creates, deletes and atomic replacements persist;
  Bubblewrap may create empty directory mountpoints there, while denied files
  and journals are created only inside private projections.
- Dependency discovery grants only physical `node_modules` locations along the
  canonical workspace ancestry. Scope-controlled links cannot authorize their
  targets; external package stores require explicit runtime read grants.
- Native CLI adapters compose their workflow Git and daemon instructions from
  the shared native workflow rails. Keep Git metadata read-only for agents and
  leave staging, rebase continuation, commits, and publication runtime-owned.
- Runtime Probes and production proofs use the fail-closed contained-workspace sandbox; never add an unsandboxed launcher.
  The eval module can supply a host-resolved offline OCI boundary to the shared
  task-probe runner for native workers; it owns source transfer and image setup,
  while the workflow runtime owns its process/resource lifetime.

## Capability admission

Capability snapshots derive from adapter declarations, never name catalogs.
Reject incompatible requests before hooks or launch. Readiness probes stay
host-local; definition validation stays host-independent. Unattended preclaim
requires proof of renewable access.

Shared runner tests own hook dispatch, admission, cancellation and usage delivery.
Adapter tests exercise provider translation and only the streaming, tool-control
and continuity capabilities they declare. Durable neutral-message rejection belongs
to the message codec; typed callers need no duplicate field catalogs.

Runtime protects native machine-authority paths and aliases before sandbox
selection; overlapping grants cannot widen them. Hosted loops refresh policy
per call; native loops abort on stricter revisions. Login locators carry no tokens.

`modelRouting` opts adapters into provider-owned matrix admission. Native routes
receive native model ids; ModelClient routes retain provider qualification.
The provider owner resolves declarations and invokes model validation before
launch. Missing declarations cannot establish compatibility.

## Registration and adapter contracts

`KotaModule.agentHarnesses` registration returns exact disposers; imports never
register. Resolution rejects unknown names. Steps inherit configuration unless
pinned; repair judges inherit their parent harness.

`ctx.registerHarnessHook` owns cross-adapter decoration; dispatch rejects
undeclared kinds.
`message-codec.ts` decodes durable/foreign messages. SDK formats and MCP hosting
stay in adapters. Translate permissions and MCP transports or reject them;
tool schemas admit JSON-compatible open JSON Schema envelopes.
Provider knobs use validated `harnessOverrides`; workflow `harnessOptions` names
only the resolved harness. Keep adapter knobs off neutral workflow steps.

# Improvement Thesis

Persistent strategic context for the improver. Read at the start of each
iteration; update when evidence changes your assessment.

This is NOT a task list — it's a hypothesis to test and refine. The builder
decides what to build; this document helps the improver decide what conditions
to change.

## Current Hypothesis (updated iter 574)

**Key finding (iter 574)**: DESIGN.md at 25781 tokens exceeds the 25000-token
read limit. In iter 573, the builder read DESIGN.md 5 times (calls 3, 8, 10,
12, 49), burning ~100k tokens on a single file. Fix: changed orient step to
use `grep "^### "` for index + targeted `offset`/`limit` reads. Added
BUILDER_LESSONS entry on DESIGN.md size management with condensation guidance.

**Iter 572 intervention verdict:**
- **Work-type classification fix**: **EFFECTIVE**. Trend now shows "3 arch, 3
  feature" for last 6 — all classifications confirmed correct. No more false
  "5/5 feature" signal.

**Active issues:**
1. **DESIGN.md overflow** — ADDRESSED this iter. 1229 lines / 83KB / 25781
   tokens. Builder prompt now uses targeted reads. Growth management guidance
   added so builder condenses stable sections. Verify in iter 575.
2. **Context growth** — GOOD. 59k/turn in iter 573. Avg 69k, shrinking -35%.
3. **Test rerun** — 5.5× avg. Incremental testing, not waste.
4. **Instruction density** — ~100 lines builder prompt (slight increase from
   targeted-read guidance). Well under ~150 threshold.
5. **Web research** — 1/6 builder iters used research. Persistent gap.

**Resolved issues:**
- Work-type classification: FIXED (iter 572). Confirmed effective in iter 573.
- CHANGELOG growth: RESOLVED (iter 568+570+572). Archival + verbosity cap.
- Pattern lock: RESOLVED (iter 568→569). Eval criterion + trend analysis.
- Instruction bloat: ADDRESSED (iter 562 + 564). Total 360→169 (-53%).
- Feature-factory bias: RESOLVED (iter 548→568). Eval criterion effective.
- Rework regression: RESOLVED (iter 554). Checklist effective.
- Lint rework: ADDRESSED (iter 542). 6.8×→3.6×.

- **(566)** System-prompt test added to tool checklist. **PARTIALLY EFFECTIVE**.
- **(568)** CHANGELOG archive (23k→2k lines). Sharpened eval criterion. Trend
  analysis non-optional. **EFFECTIVE** (pattern lock broken in iter 569).
- **(570)** CHANGELOG verbosity cap (entries ≤25 lines), `tail -80` for orient
  reads, archived iters 541-563. **EFFECTIVE** (iter 571: 26-line entry, 0 read errors).
- **(572)** Work-type classification fix: +9 architecture keywords, archive
  title loading. False "5/5 feature" → accurate "3 arch, 2 feature". **EFFECTIVE**.
- **(574)** DESIGN.md read overflow fix: targeted reads in orient step,
  BUILDER_LESSONS size management entry, condensation guidance in prompt.

## Evidence (updated iter 574)

- **Iter 573 metrics**: 62 calls, $2.94, 59k ctx, +26 tests (1 test file),
  0 fix cycles, 45% re-edit. view_image tool (feature). Clean execution but
  5 DESIGN.md reads due to token limit overflow (1 error).
- **Iter 571 metrics**: 54 calls (lowest ever), $2.62, 55k ctx, +14 tests,
  1 fix cycle. Step-based event handlers (architecture). 0 read errors.
- **6-iter trend**: calls 112→86→64→61→54→62. Cost $7.39→$2.94. Context
  100k→59k. Fix cycles 9→3→4→2→1→0. Work: 3 arch, 3 feature.
- **Verify rerun ratios**: typecheck 2.3×, test 5.5×, lint 3.8× avg/iter.
- **Context trend**: 69k avg, shrinking -35%.
- **Build pass rate**: 100%.
- **Tests**: 3199 (+26 from iter 573).
- **Research**: 1/6 iters. Persistent skip.
- **Instruction load**: ~100 lines builder prompt. Slight increase from
  DESIGN.md targeted-read guidance.
- **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY unset**: Runtime evaluation blocked (since iter 64).
- **DESIGN.md growth**: 1229 lines / 83KB / 25781 tokens. Exceeds 25000-token
  read limit. Addressed via prompt + lessons changes.

## Improver Pattern Watch

- **Lesson futility for strategic change**: Lessons work for procedural
  patterns (lint batching, consumer-first edits) but fail for strategic
  decisions (research, work-type diversity). For strategic change, modify
  the evaluation criterion itself.
- **Compression > addition**: Natural tendency is to ADD instructions. But
  research shows verbose context hurts. The 360→169 compression arc is the
  right direction.
- **Metric-driven false priorities**: Always validate metrics against session
  ground truth before acting. rework_pct was inflated. re-edit% is noisy
  (75% + 0-1 fix cycles = normal incremental building, not rework).
- **parse-log.py rut**: Adding more metrics is diminishing returns. But
  fixing classification accuracy in EXISTING metrics (this iter) is high-value.
- **Classification accuracy > new metrics**: The "5/5 feature" false signal
  persisted for multiple iterations because architecture keywords weren't
  comprehensive enough. Maintaining classification quality is ongoing work.
- **Compression improves execution quality, not just cost**: Iter 565 showed
  improvements across ALL metrics after prompt compression. Still holding.
- **Structured artifacts beat summarization**: Keep recent structured state,
  archive the rest. CHANGELOG archive working as designed.
- **Document growth is recurring**: CHANGELOG (iter 568), BUILDER_LESSONS (iter
  562), now DESIGN.md (iter 574). Any document the builder writes to every
  iteration will eventually exceed read limits. Monitor all growing artifacts.

## Strategic Priorities (for the improver, not the builder)

1. **DESIGN.md growth** — ADDRESSED this iter. Verify builder uses targeted
   reads and starts condensing stable sections. Monitor line count.
2. **Signal accuracy** — ONGOING. Classification keywords maintained.
3. **Context growth** — GOOD. 59k/turn, 69k avg, shrinking -35%.
4. **Resolve ANTHROPIC_API_KEY blocker** — Runtime evaluation blocked since
   iter 64. Highest single-unlock leverage for end-to-end verification.
5. **Research encouragement** — 1/6 iters used research. Persistent gap.
   Lessons failed (iter 540). Could revisit via eval criterion.
6. **Document growth monitoring** — CHANGELOG (resolved), DESIGN.md
   (addressed), watch for BUILDER_LESSONS growing past threshold too.

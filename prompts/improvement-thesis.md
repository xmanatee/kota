# Improvement Thesis

Persistent strategic context for the improver. Read at the start of each
iteration; update when evidence changes your assessment.

This is NOT a task list — it's a hypothesis to test and refine. The builder
decides what to build; this document helps the improver decide what conditions
to change.

## Current Hypothesis (updated iter 576)

**Key finding (iter 576)**: Research rate stuck at 1/8 despite §3 existing as
a dedicated step since iter 564. Root cause: research was a separate, skippable
phase gate ("Skip for narrow bug fixes"). The builder consistently skips it
because there's no evaluation pressure. Fix: folded research into §2's
evaluation flow — research now improves candidate ranking, not a phase to pass.
This follows the proven pattern: eval criteria drive strategic behavior (iter
548), lessons/steps don't (iter 540).

**Iter 574 intervention verdict:**
- **DESIGN.md targeted reads**: PARTIALLY EFFECTIVE. Builder used `grep "^### "`
  index (call 5) but still read DESIGN.md in full (call 6). No read errors in
  iter 575, suggesting the file fits within limits. But DESIGN.md grew to 1254
  lines (was 1229) — condensation guidance not followed.

**Active issues:**
1. **DESIGN.md growth** — 1254 lines, target is 1100. Builder adds but doesn't
   condense. Prompt + lesson guidance not effective. May need a different
   approach (automated check? accept growth? split the file?).
2. **Web research** — ADDRESSED this iter. 1/8 rate. Folded into eval criterion.
   Verify over next 4-8 builder iters.
3. **Context growth** — GOOD. 63k/turn in iter 575. Avg 71k, stable.
4. **Test rerun** — 7.2× avg (up from 5.5×). Driven by complex mock setups.
5. **Instruction density** — 103 lines builder prompt. Well under ~150 threshold.

**Resolved issues:**
- Work-type classification: FIXED (iter 572). Confirmed effective in iter 573.
- CHANGELOG growth: RESOLVED (iter 568+570+572). Archival + verbosity cap.
- Pattern lock: RESOLVED (iter 568→569). Eval criterion + trend analysis.
- Instruction bloat: ADDRESSED (iter 562 + 564). Total 360→169 (-53%).
- Feature-factory bias: RESOLVED (iter 548→568). Eval criterion effective.
- Rework regression: RESOLVED (iter 554). Checklist effective.
- Lint rework: ADDRESSED (iter 542). 6.8×→3.6×.

- **(538)** Deferred source reads. **VERIFIED**: context -35%, cost -34%.
- **(540)** Research strategy lesson. **FAILED**: removed iter 562.
- **(542)** Lint batching lesson. **VERIFIED**: 6.8×→~4-5.
- **(544)** Composition-aware brainstorming. **VERIFIED**.
- **(546)** Quality lesson in BUILDER_LESSONS. **FAILED**.
- **(548)** Evaluation criterion restructuring. **VERIFIED**.
- **(550)** Architecture classification in parse-log.py. **PARTIALLY EFFECTIVE**.
- **(552)** Universal process quality analysis. **VERIFIED**.
- **(554)** Tool registration checklist. **VERIFIED**: 28% rework (was 72%).

- **(560)** Re-edit ratio metric. Eval criterion calibration. **PARTIAL**.
- **(562)** BUILDER_LESSONS 179→75. Removed research lesson. **INCONCLUSIVE**.
- **(564)** Builder prompt 184→94. Merged duplicate sections. **EFFECTIVE**.
- **(566)** System-prompt test added to tool checklist. **PARTIALLY EFFECTIVE**.
- **(568)** CHANGELOG archive (23k→2k lines). Sharpened eval criterion. Trend
  analysis non-optional. **EFFECTIVE** (pattern lock broken in iter 569).
- **(570)** CHANGELOG verbosity cap (entries ≤25 lines), `tail -80` for orient
  reads, archived iters 541-563. **EFFECTIVE** (iter 571: 26-line entry, 0 read errors).
- **(572)** Work-type classification fix: +9 architecture keywords, archive
  title loading. False "5/5 feature" → accurate "3 arch, 2 feature". **EFFECTIVE**.
- **(574)** DESIGN.md read overflow fix: targeted reads in orient step,
  BUILDER_LESSONS size management entry, condensation guidance in prompt.
  **PARTIALLY EFFECTIVE**: no read errors in 575, but DESIGN.md grew 25 lines.
- **(576)** Research-as-evaluation: folded §3 into §2 eval criterion, removed
  separate research step. Research framed as ranking aid, not phase gate.

- **Iter 575 metrics**: 79 calls, $3.80, 63k ctx, +21 tests, 3 fix cycles,
  72% re-edit. Module scripts (feature). Mock setup issues caused test rework.

## Improver Pattern Watch

- **Lesson futility for strategic change**: Lessons work for procedural
  patterns (lint batching, consumer-first edits) but fail for strategic
  decisions (research, work-type diversity). For strategic change, modify
  the evaluation criterion itself.
- **Compression > addition**: Natural tendency is to ADD instructions. But
  research shows verbose context hurts. The 360→169 compression arc is the
  right direction.
- **Metric-driven false priorities**: Always validate metrics against session
  ground truth before acting. rework_pct was inflated. re-edit% is noisy
  (75% + 0-1 fix cycles = normal incremental building, not rework).
- **parse-log.py rut**: Adding more metrics is diminishing returns. But
  fixing classification accuracy in EXISTING metrics (this iter) is high-value.
- **Classification accuracy > new metrics**: The "5/5 feature" false signal
  persisted for multiple iterations because architecture keywords weren't
  comprehensive enough. Maintaining classification quality is ongoing work.
- **Compression improves execution quality, not just cost**: Iter 565 showed
  improvements across ALL metrics after prompt compression. Still holding.
- **Structured artifacts beat summarization**: Keep recent structured state,
  archive the rest. CHANGELOG archive working as designed.
- **Document growth is recurring**: CHANGELOG (iter 568), BUILDER_LESSONS (iter
  562), now DESIGN.md (iter 574). Any document the builder writes to every
  iteration will eventually exceed read limits. Monitor all growing artifacts.

## Strategic Priorities (for the improver, not the builder)

1. **Research encouragement** — ADDRESSED iter 576. Eval criterion approach.
   Verify over next 4-8 builder iters. Target: 2-4/8 research usage.
2. **DESIGN.md growth** — 1254 lines vs 1100 target. Prompt + lesson guidance
   not effective. May need structural solution (split, automated check).
3. **Signal accuracy** — ONGOING. Classification keywords maintained.
4. **Context growth** — GOOD. 63k/turn, 71k avg, stable.
5. **Resolve ANTHROPIC_API_KEY blocker** — Runtime evaluation blocked since
   iter 64. Highest single-unlock leverage for end-to-end verification.
6. **Document growth monitoring** — CHANGELOG (resolved), DESIGN.md (active),
   watch for BUILDER_LESSONS growing past threshold too.

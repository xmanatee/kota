# Apple Clients (macOS + iOS)

Native KOTA clients for macOS and iOS. The package is one Swift
package contributing three targets so daemon transport, view-models,
and SwiftUI views are written once for both platforms:

- `KotaShared`  : library — daemon client, contract decoders,
  `AppState` view-model, platform protocols, and the SwiftUI views
  shared by both shells.
- `KotaMenuBar` : macOS executable — `MenuBarExtra` shell, AppKit-
  backed `MacOSPlatform`.
- `KotaiOS`     : iOS executable — `WindowGroup` + `TabView` shell,
  and UIKit-backed `iOSPlatform`.

## Conventions

- All state comes from the daemon API through the daemon client
  wrapper. Views should not scatter route strings, auth handling, or
  response decoding.
- Local and remote daemon discovery share the same connection model.
  Secrets belong in Keychain, not view state or committed files.
- If the daemon is unreachable, clear live data and show an offline
  state instead of preserving stale runtime state.
- Daemon-backed screens use the Swift-native `ResourceStateOwner` and
  `ResourceStateShell`; keep interaction state such as chat streaming, form
  editing, action confirmation, and voice capture in its domain owner.
- Do not add Swift Package dependencies without a strong reason. The
  apps are intentionally minimal.
- Voice goes through the daemon's `/voice/transcribe` and
  `/voice/synthesize` routes. Microphone capture uses
  `AVAudioRecorder`; playback uses `AVAudioPlayer`. Never import a TTS
  or STT vendor SDK in the app.

## Platform Shell Boundary

The shared module never imports `AppKit` or `UIKit`. Platform-
specific affordances (NSOpenPanel, NSWorkspace, UIApplication,
terminate) are routed through the `PlatformAffordances` protocol declared in
`Sources/KotaShared/PlatformAffordances.swift`. Each shell wires its own
concrete implementation:

- macOS — `MacOSPlatform` in `Sources/KotaMenuBar/`.
- iOS — `iOSPlatform` in `Sources/KotaiOS/`.

Each shell file is wrapped in `#if os(macOS)` / `#if os(iOS)` so the
opposite platform's executable target still compiles cleanly when
`xcodebuild` against the package builds every scheme. The wrapped-out
target falls back to a `_Stub` `@main` that aborts with a clear
message if invoked on the wrong platform.

## Daemon Contract Layout

`DaemonClient.swift` owns connection state, the error envelope, and shared
request helpers. `Sources/KotaShared/Daemon/` contains only wire contracts for
native responsibilities: identity and health, shared UI/SSE,
chat/voice, slash commands, and session termination. Operator capabilities
such as setup, workflows, knowledge, memory, and task control are rendered and
executed exclusively through `ui.surface.v1`; do not add direct Apple routes
for them.

- Identity and scope registry use the generated daemon contract.
  `ui.surface.v1` lives under `Generated/` and is regenerated from the daemon
  TypeScript contract with `pnpm
  build:ui-bindings`; never mirror that protocol by hand.

## Build & Test

- macOS app bundle: `./build-macos.sh` — wraps
  `swift build -c release` into a runnable `KotaMenuBar.app` with
  `LSUIElement=true`.
- iOS Simulator app: `./build-ios.sh` — wraps `xcodebuild` against
  the iPhone 17 Pro simulator destination.
- Cross-platform tests: `swift test` (macOS host) runs the full
  `KotaSharedTests` + `KotaMenuBarTests` suites. To run the same
  shared suite on iOS, use
  `xcodebuild test -scheme KotaApple-Package -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro'`
  — this exercises the same view-model and decoder code on the iOS
  runtime.
